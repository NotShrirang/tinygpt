# Training and Evaluation Details

## Training Techniques

The training process for the TinyGPT model implements several advanced techniques to efficiently train a GPT-style language model on the TinyStories dataset. Below is a detailed breakdown of the techniques used:

### Model Architecture

- **Transformer-Based**: Implements a standard GPT architecture with transformer blocks
- **Size**: ~50M parameters (confirmed in notebook logs)
- **Configuration**:
  - Embedding dimension (`n_embd`): 512
  - Attention heads (`n_head`): 8
  - Transformer layers (`n_layer`): 8
  - Dropout rate: 0.3
  - Block size (context window): 512 tokens
  - Vocabulary size: 50,304 tokens (based on GPT-2 tokenizer)

### Tokenization

- Uses the `tiktoken` library with the GPT-2 tokenizer model
- Custom `Tokenizer` class handles encoding and decoding operations
- No custom BOS token, using standard GPT-2 EOS token

### Dataset and Batching

- Training on the "TinyStories" dataset from Hugging Face (`roneneldan/TinyStories`)
- Implements effective batch size accumulation:
  - Actual batch size: 32 samples
  - Target batch size: 16,384 (8192 \* 2) samples
  - Gradient accumulation steps: 512 (target_batch_size // batch_size)
- Data processing:
  - Truncates sequences to maximum block_size (512 tokens)
  - Pads shorter sequences to uniform length

### Optimization Techniques

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay
  - Learning rate: 7e-5
  - Weight decay: 0.1
  - Betas: (0.9, 0.95)
  - Epsilon: 1e-8
  - Uses fused implementation when available on CUDA for better performance
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: OneCycleLR
  - Maximum learning rate: 8e-5
  - Percentage of warmup: 5% of total steps
  - Total steps calculated based on effective batch updates (train_dataloader_length // gradient_accumulation_steps)
- **Mixed Precision Training**:
  - Uses `torch.autocast` with `bfloat16` precision for forward passes
  - Helps reduce memory usage and increase training speed
- **Gradient Clipping**: Applied with max norm of 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients
- **PyTorch Compilation**: Uses `torch.compile()` to optimize model execution

### Training Loop Details

- **Gradient Accumulation**:
  - Forward/backward passes performed on small batches (32)
  - Optimizer step only after accumulating gradients for 512 batches
  - Effectively simulates training on much larger batches (16,384 samples)
- **Validation**:
  - Performed every 2 gradient accumulation cycles (or at the end of training)
  - Uses 256 validation samples for quick evaluation
  - Tracks both training and validation loss
- **Checkpointing**:
  - Saves model state at each validation step
  - Maintains loss records and generation samples in "losses.txt"
- **Generation Sampling**:
  - At each validation step, generates text with the prompt "One day, a "
  - Uses multinomial sampling from softmax-normalized logits

### Weight Initialization and Optimization

- Careful weight initialization:
  - Linear layers: Normal distribution with mean=0.0, std=0.02
  - Biases initialized to zeros
  - Embedding layers: Normal distribution with mean=0.0, std=0.02
- Weight tying between token embeddings and final output projection layers

### Hardware Optimization

- Detects and utilizes CUDA if available
- Sets PyTorch's float32 matmul precision to 'high' for better performance
- Implements memory clearing with `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

The implementation demonstrates several best practices for training transformer language models, particularly the careful balance between memory constraints and effective batch size through gradient accumulation, mixed-precision training, and learning rate scheduling.

### Losses and Performance

|   Step | Learing Rate | Training Loss | Validation Loss | Output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
